Q3: Which devices are the majority of our customers using? How can we optimize the user experience based on this insight?

-- Exploring session data
SELECT * 
FROM data_analysis.customer_sessions 
LIMIT 10;

-- Counting sessions by device type
SELECT 
    device_type, 
    COUNT(*) AS session_count,
    ROUND((COUNT(*) * 100.0) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
FROM data_analysis.customer_sessions
GROUP BY device_type
ORDER BY session_count DESC;

-- Device usage trends offer insights into customer engagement and platform-specific optimizations.
