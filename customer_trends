-- Q2: What is the correlation between batched orders and customer support inquiries? How can we minimize potential challenges?

-- Joining orders with support contacts
SELECT 
    o.*, 
    s.*
FROM data_analysis.orders_table o
JOIN data_analysis.support_contacts s
    ON o.order_id = s.order_id;

-- Filtering for fulfilled batched orders
SELECT 
    o.*, 
    s.*
FROM data_analysis.orders_table o
JOIN data_analysis.support_contacts s
    ON o.order_id = s.order_id
WHERE o.is_fulfilled = 1 
  AND o.is_batched = TRUE;

-- Counting unique orders per contact reason
SELECT 
    s.contact_reason, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM data_analysis.orders_table o
JOIN data_analysis.support_contacts s
    ON o.order_id = s.order_id
WHERE o.is_fulfilled = 1 
  AND o.is_batched = TRUE
GROUP BY s.contact_reason
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- Various factors contribute to customer interactions, and a deeper analysis of operational workflows may help identify opportunities for improvement.
