-- Q1: What types of orders are accepted the most by couriers during peak hours? How can we maximize the amount of orders accepted based on this data?

-- Initial exploration to understand table structure
SELECT * 
FROM data_analysis.orders_table 
LIMIT 10;

-- Checking distinct time periods for order distribution
SELECT DISTINCT meal_time_category 
FROM data_analysis.orders_table;

-- Counting total orders by meal time category
SELECT 
    meal_time_category, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM data_analysis.orders_table
GROUP BY meal_time_category
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

-- Identifying popular product categories for peak time
SELECT 
    product_category, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM data_analysis.orders_table
WHERE meal_time_category = 'Meal Time A' 
  AND accepted_time IS NOT NULL -- Only includes accepted orders
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

-- Calculating acceptance rates by meal time category
SELECT 
    o.meal_time_category,
    COUNT_IF(is_accepted) / COUNT(*) AS acceptance_rate
FROM data_analysis.assignments_table a
INNER JOIN data_analysis.orders_table o 
    ON a.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY o.meal_time_category;

-- To optimize performance, different strategies can be explored based on meal time variations and courier preferences.

Q3: Which devices are the majority of our customers using? How can we optimize the user experience based on this insight?

-- Exploring session data
SELECT * 
FROM data_analysis.customer_sessions 
LIMIT 10;

-- Counting sessions by device type
SELECT 
    device_type, 
    COUNT(*) AS session_count,
    ROUND((COUNT(*) * 100.0) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
FROM data_analysis.customer_sessions
GROUP BY device_type
ORDER BY session_count DESC;

-- Device usage trends offer insights into customer engagement and platform-specific optimizations.
